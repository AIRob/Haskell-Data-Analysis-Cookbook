# Summary
### Chapter 1
*The Hunt for Data*, identifies core approaches in reading data from various external sources such as **CSV**, **JSON**, **XML**, **HTML**, **MongoDB**, and **SQLite**.

### Chapter 2
*Integrity and Inspection*, explains the importance of cleaning data through recipes about **trimming whitespace**, **lexing**, and **regular expression matching**.

### Chapter 3
*The Science of Words*, introduces common string manipulation algorithms including **base conversions**, **substring matching**, and **computing the edit distance**.

### Chapter 4
*Data Hashing*, covers essential hashing functions such as **MD5**, **SHA256**, **GeoHashing**, and **perceptual hashing**.

### Chapter 5
*A Dance with Trees*, establishes an understanding of the tree data structure through examples including **tree traversals**, **balancing trees**, and **Huffman coding**.

### Chapter 6
*Graph Fundamentals*, manifests rudimentary algorithms for graphical networks such as **graph traversals**, **visualization**, and **maximal clique detection**.

### Chapter 7
*Statistics and Analysis*, begins the investigation of important data analysis techniques encompassing **regression algorithms**, **Bayesian networks**, and **neural networks**.

### Chapter 8
*Clustering and Classification*, involves quintessential analysis methods involving **k-means clustering**, **hierarchical clustering**, **constructing decision trees**, and **implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier**.

### Chapter 9
*Parallel and Concurrent Design*, introduces advance topics in Haskell such as **forking IO actions**, **mapping over lists in parallel**, and **benchmarking performance**.

### Chapter 10
*Real-time Fugue*, incorporates streamed data interactions from **Twitter**, **Internet Relay Chat (IRC)**, and **sockets**.

### Chapter 11
*Stunning Visuals*, comprises of sundry approaches to plotting graphs including **line charts**, **bar graphs**, **scatter plots**, and **D3.js visualizations**.

### Chapter 12
